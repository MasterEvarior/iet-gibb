      EyeCon is the most innovative SaaS(Software-as-a-Service) institution since the beginning of the 4th Century. Built from a modern stack of Agile AI, Deep Learning, Blockchain and Java 1.2 we deliver a reactive user experience.
      Our most innovative (and only) product is an IaaS(Ifconfig-as-a-Service) running on our trustworthy Windows 95 server cluster running tirelessly on a VM(Virtual Machine) inside a Docker container which are also running on Kubernetes. RUN-CEPTION!
      Of course it makes use of the cutting-edge microservice architecture pattern but with only one service which has one instance.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our exceptionally futuristic name comes from Ifconfig, which we shortened to Icon. But after our discovery that that word already exists (can you imagine?) we decided to not compete with them. Instead we just changed our name to EyeCon[ˈaɪkɒn]. Because it sounds the same, nevermind the writing.
      <br>
      <br>
      Because we are a forward-thinking company of the future and high consumer demand(that's at least what Fred from the vegan DevOps team said) the only way to pay for our premium plans is BitCoin. Take that Elon Musk!
      It will also be the solution to climate change because if no one pays with paper, no trees will be cut down for money.
      <br>
      <br>
      We sincerely belive that our product will change the world for the better and improve the life of every single human being.
